# README

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Files

The repo contains the following files:
  - `run_analysis.R`: The R script that performs the data cleaning and transformation.
- `CodeBook.md`: A code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations performed.
- `README.md`: This file, which explains the analysis files and how they are connected.

## Analysis

The `run_analysis.R` script performs the following steps:
  1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts measurements on the mean and standard deviation.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities.
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
